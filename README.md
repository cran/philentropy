### Similarity and Distance Quantification between Probability Functions

> Describe and understand the world through data.

Data collection and data comparison are the foundations of scientific research.
_Mathematics_ provides the abstract framework to describe patterns we observe in nature and _Statistics_ provides the
framework to quantify the uncertainty of these patterns. In statistics, natural patterns
are described in form of probability distributions which either follow a fixed pattern (parametric distributions) or more dynamic patterns (non-parametric distributions).

The `philentropy` package implements fundamental distance and similarity measures to quantify distances between probability density functions as well as traditional information theory measures. In this regard, it aims to provide a framework for comparing
natural patterns in a statistical notation.  

This project is born out of my passion for statistics and I hope that it will be useful to
the people who share it with me.
